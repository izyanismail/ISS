Hello.
The project had been done in Microsoft Visual Studio 10 using ASP.NET (C#).
As this is my first time using github,the first version of the project had been upload wrongly.
The final version of the project should be the folder name NeXTFINAL.
To read the folder open the folder in Microsoft Visual Studio.
Then run in the localhost.
User need to enter date and time then click the "Go !" button.
The project may not be open in latest Microsoft Visual Studio.
WARNING !!!-Beware of the bizzare frontend design.
